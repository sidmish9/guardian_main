# THE GUARDIAN PROTOCOL

One of the overlooked, yet critical problems that the pandemic is continuously exposing, is the staggering rate at which crucial medical information and practices, spread without verification,a trusted fact-check, or with less or no scientific validation. The current means to verify a certain fact or procedure, is to either research yourself , or wait for validation by any of your trusted source (like your doctor, govt etc).

Now its rather clear that the first method is time consuming, and requires you yourself to have experience and knowledge in the relevant field which won't be the case most of the time.

However, the second option seems more feasible, doesn't it? you could simply ask your trusted source, like a doctor, or the government officials.
The problem here is that most of the times, your trusted source could be prone to error itself, simply because most of the time, **your "source" is not incentivized to provide you the _factually correct_ information.**


# Whitepaper
The problem addressed here is that of **authority over information**, So imagine that there is a person  **p**, who has is trusted source **A** for a fact check of a statement **S**. Since p is no expert in the field ( presumable as no person is an expert of everything)

A few obvious points are

 - A as a person, could be biased for not providing the correct information to p
 - A as an organization would provide the information that is in accordance to the organization's profit. (even NGO's can have the institution bias)
 - A as a govt/party would also provide the information which addresses their influence / power
 - A could also be a Research paper but Research papers too, could be biased to promote a certain 'version' of truth. 

The implication here is not that there is no way to fact check a medical statement in this way, rather, the claim is that  **the probability of A providing a an incorrect (partial or full) validation to S, is high **

## Solution

decentralization is one of the solutions to increase the probability of a correct validation to S, for which A has to be eliminated, and replaced with an Medical expert who is 'truth incentivized' individual , lets call him/her A#

**now a  consortium of  these 'truth incentivized' People  A#  will be formed on a blockchain** 

This blockchain would have multiple Medical experts like A# coexisting without any conflict, while being free to express their fact check over the statement chosen by the users.

This blockchain is the guardian blockchain.

The fact check would be complete, as after the **allotted pool time** the most voted fact check would be chosen as the correct one.
The experts who had voted the now-determined correct fact check, would be rewarded with the **Guardian Token.**

### THE GUARDIAN TOKEN

The guardian token would be an ERC token minted for the side-chain, which is a reward for the participants of the guardian blockchain.

The tokenomics of this would enable this token to be rare and fungible, providing a good incentive for the Medical Experts

There would be features like

 1. Low circulated supply
 2. Negligible pre-minting
 3. Less tokens available for ICOs

### FAQS

#### What if the correct medical information changes ?
According to the history of the blockchain the nodes who responded earlier with the now correct information, would be rewarded, the proof of new information will also totally be from the blockchain .
#### Who are the users ?
the users could be anyone with an ethereum wallet, they would vote for Medical fact (in a format) which would then be fact checked by the Medical experts on the guardian blockchain
#### How does it maintain the privacy of the Medical experts ?
The medical experts undergo a KYC process, which is also done exclusively to protect their privacy, and **no** user can see any detail of any medical expert on the blockchain apart form his/her ethereum address and vote.

#### Does it guarantee a successful fact check
The system doesn't assure the absolute correct fact check as the science could itself be wrong, however it is proven to provide the solution with **the highest probability of being correct.**


#### Word to judges
The 100% implementation of this protocol, is beyond the scope of my expertise and experience as I am a beginner in the field, Your inputs are valuable to me, Kindly contact me if you find this idea potent enough.



Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
